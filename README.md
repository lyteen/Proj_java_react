## Compose sample application
### React application with a Spring backend and a MySQL database

Project structure:
```
.
├── backend
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ...
├── db
│   └── password.txt
├── compose.yaml
├── frontend
│   ├── ...
│   └── Dockerfile
└── README.md
```

[_compose.yaml_](compose.yaml)
```
services:
  backend:
    build: backend
    ...
  db:
    # We use a mariadb image which supports both amd64 & arm64 architecture
    image: mariadb:10.6.4-focal
    # If you really want to use MySQL, uncomment the following line
    #image: mysql:8.0.27
    ...
  frontend:
    build: frontend
    ports:
    - 3000:3000
    ...
```
The compose file defines an application with three services `frontend`, `backend` and `db`.
When deploying the application, docker compose maps port 3000 of the frontend service container to port 3000 of the host as specified in the file.
Make sure port 3000 on the host is not already being in use.

After the application starts, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser to get a colorful message.
